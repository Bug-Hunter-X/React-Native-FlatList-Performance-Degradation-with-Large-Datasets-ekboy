# React Native FlatList Performance Issue

This repository demonstrates a common performance issue encountered when using `FlatList` in React Native with large datasets.  The issue manifests as slow scrolling and lagging, even after implementing optimizations like `keyExtractor` and `removeClippedSubviews`.

## Problem

The provided `FlatList` component, when populated with a substantial dataset, exhibits significant performance degradation. Scrolling becomes sluggish, and the application may freeze or lag on lower-end devices.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates methods to optimize performance, such as using `windowSize` and `getItemLayout` to improve rendering efficiency. The implementation also leverages React Native's `VirtualizedList`'s features for better memory management.
